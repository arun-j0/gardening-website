1)Clone the Project: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone <repository-url>

2)Navigate to the Project Directory: Once you've cloned the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3)Install Dependencies: In a React project, you use npm or Yarn to install dependencies listed in the package.json file.

npm install
or
yarn install
This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

4)Start the Development Server: After installing dependencies, you can start the development server to run the React project locally.

npm start
or
yarn start
This command starts the development server and opens the project in your default web browser. You can now view and interact with your React application in the browser.
